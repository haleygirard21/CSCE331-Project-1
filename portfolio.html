                  In the Summer of 2020, I volunteered to draft a logo design for the Lake Travis Trail Coalition 
                  (<b><a href="https://www.laketravistrails.org/">LTTC</a></b>), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit  that supports the development and maintenance
                   of a safe, sustainable trail network in the Lake Travis area of Austin, Texas that is accessible to all users. I also created 
                   homemade physical trail signs for this project and went with a team of local trail-builders and enthusiasts to put them up across our multi-use trail system.

                <p class="intro_text">
                  <strong></strong>During the Summer of 2022, I interned for a Functional Medicine Doctor (see my <b><a href="qualifications.html">Qualifications</a></b> for more
                   information), who used an outdated, bare-boned HTML structure in what she called her patients' nutritional recommendations
                  page; a database program, where each patient's individualized list of test kits and supplements as recommended by the doctor 
                  were saved into a private server system, following HIPPA Law regulations.
                  
                  <br><br>When the officer manager first introduced me to how to edit this program—which had been previously modified by employees
                  with no true coding experience—was overwhelmed by its lack of organization, structure, and the amount of basic syntactical
                  errors that made me question how the code was even able to function as intended. With my basic background in HTML and coding
                  knowledge from past semesters, I offered to take on the project of debugging and nearly rewriting the entire system to be more
                  user-friendly for the other employees to be able to continue updating in the future. I even consulted with the doctor personally,
                  in order to include any changes that she was hoping to implement into the system and by the end of the summer, I'd done all that
                  they has asked of me, and left with a better sense of understanding in terms of working with HTML, private server systems, and
                  how to collaborate effectively and beneficially in a team environment.

                  <br><br>In addition to the above project, I also aided in creating simple graphics and posts for the Doctor's social media pages,
                   including Instagram and Pinterest, as well as for the supplement shop on her website.
